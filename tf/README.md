## Introduction

This directory contains our TF implementation of Transformer-XL. Note that our state-of-the-art results reported in the paper were obtained by training the model on a large-scale TPU cluster, and our gpu codebase currently does not support distributed training. Here we provide two sets of hyperparameters and scripts:
- `*large_tpu.sh` are for the SoTA setting on TPUs. These are exactly the commands we used to obtained our best results.
- `*base_gpu.sh` are for the base models which can be run on a few GPUs.


## Prerequisite

- Python 2.7
- Tensorflow [1.12.0](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v1.12.0)



## Obtain and evaluate pretrained SoTA models

#### 1. Download preprocessed data (vocab) & pretrained models

(a) Set your own `DATA_ROOT` in `sota/download.sh` (default to `./`), which will be the root diretory of downloaded model.

(b) Then, download the model & data by `bash sota/download.sh`. After downloading, the expected directory structure is as follows

```markdown
pretrained_xl
  tf_enwik8/
    data/
      cache.pkl
      corpus-info.json
    model/
      checkpoint
      model.ckpt*
  tf_wt103/
  	...
  ...
```

**Note**: we include preprocessed data in the download files to make sure the **same vocabulary** is used. Please see the code `tf/data_utils.py` to understand the data structure.



#### 2. Run evaluation scripts to replicate SoTA results on GPUs

- **enwik8**: modify the script `sota/enwik8.sh` accordingly (see below)
  - set `DATA_ROOT` to the same folder used in the download step (default to `./`)
  - set `TEST_NUM_CORE ` (number of GPUs to use): we recommend 2 GPUs => about 60 mins
  - run the script: `bash sota/enwik8.sh`

- **lm1b**: modify the script `sota/lm1b.sh` accordingly  (see below)
  - set `DATA_ROOT` to the same folder used in the download step (default to `./`)
  - set `TEST_NUM_CORE ` (number of GPUs to use): we recommend 1 GPUs => less than 5 mins
  - run the script: `bash sota/lm1b.sh`

- **wt103**:  modify the script `sota/wt103.sh` accordingly  (see below)
  - set `DATA_ROOT` to the same folder used in the download step (default to `./`)
  - set `TEST_NUM_CORE ` (number of GPUs to use): we recommend 1 GPUs => less than 5 mins
  - run the script: `bash sota/wt103.sh`

- **text8**:  modify the script `sota/text8.sh` accordingly  (see below)
  - set `DATA_ROOT` to the same folder used in the download step (default to `./`)
  - set `TEST_NUM_CORE ` (number of GPUs to use): we recommend 2 GPUs => about 60 mins
  - run the script: `bash sota/text8.sh`


#### 3. Resources Needed for SoTA Model Training

We used 32, 32, 64, and 512 TPU cores for training our best models on enwik8, text8, wt103, and lm1b respectively. The training time for each model ranges from 2 to 5 days.



## Train "Transformer-XL" from scratch with GPUs or TPUs

### 1. Download raw data

`bash getdata.sh`



### 2. Preprocess, training and evaluation

For `dataset` in `[enwik8, lm1b, wt103, text8]`:

- check out `scripts/dataset_base_gpu.sh` for GPU training and evaluation
- check out `scripts/dataset_large_tpu.sh` for TPU training and evaluation



#### (1) Preprocess raw data and create tfrecords

**NOTE**: The preprocessing for GPU and TPU are different. So, you have to run them separately.

GPU:

- create training and validation data: `bash scripts/dataset_bas_gpu.sh train_data`
- create test data: `bash scripts/dataset_base_gpu.sh test_data`

TPU:

- Set the Google storage URL  in `scripts/dataset_large_tpu.sh`:
  - `GSDATA`: data URL
  - `GSEXP`: experiment URL
- create training and validation data: `bash scripts/dataset_large_tpu.sh train_data`
- create test data: `bash scripts/dataset_large_tpu.sh test_data`



#### (2) Run training

Base models on GPUs:

- Modify the configurations in `scripts/dataset_base_gpu.sh`  according to your needs.
- `bash scripts/dataset_base_gpu.sh train`
- If enough resources are available, increasing the model sizes (e.g., `N_LAYER`, `D_MODEL`, `D_EMBED`, `D_HEAD`, `D_INNER`) so that they are closer to the values defined in `scripts/dataset_large_tpu.sh`. Likewise, when resources are limited, decrease the model sizes. It is recommended to ensure that `D_MODEL == D_EMBED` and `D_MODEL == N_HEAD x D_HEAD`. When the model sizes increase, remember to increase `warmup_steps` accordingly to alleviate optimization difficulties.
- Adjust the `NUM_CORE` parameter to reflect the number of GPUs to use.

Larger models on TPUs:

- Modify the configurations in `scripts/dataset_large_tpu.sh`  according to your needs.
- `bash scripts/dataset_large_tpu.sh train`



#### (3) Run evaluation

Base models on GPUs:

- `bash scripts/dataset_base_gpu.sh eval --eval_ckpt_path PATH_TO_CKPT`

Larger models on TPUs:

- `bash scripts/dataset_large_tpu.sh eval --eval_ckpt_path PATH_TO_CKPT`
